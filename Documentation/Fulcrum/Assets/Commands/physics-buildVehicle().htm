         This command will build your vehicle for you, you must have already called FulcrumPhy::makeVehicle().
         You should also have added at least one shape to the shape list, this will become the vehicle hull,
         lastly, you should have called FulcrumPhy::makeWheelShape() for each of your vehicles wheels.
         This command will then take all that data and create your vehicle, you can then control your vehicle
         using FulcrumPhy::driveWheel() and FulcrumPhy::steerWheel(), you can also apply forces to the vehicle
         using the regular force/torque commands if you wish.
