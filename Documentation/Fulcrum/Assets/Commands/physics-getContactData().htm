	This command will check to see if any contacts have been added to the stack. You setup contact pairs using 
        FulcrumPhy::setContactPair(), any contact between these actors/objects will then be added to the stack.
        If there is at least one contact, you can get information about which objects were involved using 
        FulcrumPhy::getContactActorA() and FulcrumPhy::getContactActorB(). Its good to note that two or more
        contacts may be added to the stack in one cycle so you may want to call this command repeatedly until
        it returns false.
