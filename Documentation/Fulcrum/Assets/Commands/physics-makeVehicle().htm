         This creates a vehicle, you should add shapes to the shape list the same as you do when you make a compound actor,
         these shapes become the vehicle body. You also add any required wheels at this point.
         Once you have added your wheels and you have at least one shape on the shape list you call FulcrumPhy::buildVehicle(), this 
         will put everything together and create your vehicle actor.
