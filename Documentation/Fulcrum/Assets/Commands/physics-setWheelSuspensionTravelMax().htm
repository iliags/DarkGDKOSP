	This command will set the maximum distance the wheel can travel vertically away from the vehicle
        as the vehicle comes away from the ground. This simulates vehicle suspension, a soft contact is made with 
        the surface if the car raises off the ground less than the maximum suspension travel distance, a hard contact is
        made when the wheel is in its initial local position, in other words the suspension travel is at zero.
