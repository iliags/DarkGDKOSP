        This command will update all your objects so their positions and orientations match
        that of their actor counterparts in the physics simulation. This will update everything, including
        all dynamic actors, controllers and vehicle wheels. There are commands to update each of these
        separately if you want more control but if you use this then you will not need to call them.
