        Updates a single dynamic actor, this command positions and orientates your object to match
        the respective actors position and orientation in the physics simulation. You may save some cpu
        using this version of the function because of the way it updates the matrix directly, as a side effect
        of this DarkGDK will loose track of the objects orientation, it also will not work on objects 
        that have been scaled. If you update some objects with this command you may also need to call
        FulcrumPhy::updateActor() on any remaining dynamic objects, FulcrumPhy::updateControllers() if 
        you have any controllers in the scene and FulcrumPhy::updateWheels() on any vehicle you have created.
