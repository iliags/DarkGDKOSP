I know may be premature but I created a TTF of the yellow font I did for the "buttons". I called it ZarDOSP!... LOL

I am allowing all of you who work on DOSP to grab a copy. I am permitting DOSP USE ONLY! Any other use, unless it's in a game that someone is building, must ask my permission FIRST, then grant me credits in TWO PLACES: Paper/PDF Documentation -AND- in the Game's Credits Screen.

Thank you.

Please note that there are no special "foreign" characters yet, and there are some "glyphs" that were predefined that I didn't change/delete. If you need those, I will update this font to accommodate those. Just ask. Thanks.
